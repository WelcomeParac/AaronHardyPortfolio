My focus on simplicity and clear communication was evident through the use of clean typography, a limited color palette, and generous white space. The result was an asethetically pleasing layout that  enabled seamless content navigation, emphasizing the vital role of design in delivering the history of those rally cars, ensuring the readers can engage in the text without distractions or information overload.</div>
