            Original Packaging Felt Uninspiring and Outdated
            <br>
            <br>
                Sunbelt Bakery's original granola bar packaging design was perceived as uninspiring and old-fashioned, which hindered its appeal to modern consumers. 
                The packaging lacked modern branding elements, including storytelling, mission-driven messaging, and bold visual appeal. 
                It may have been too simple and conservative, failing to stand out on the competitive store shelves.
